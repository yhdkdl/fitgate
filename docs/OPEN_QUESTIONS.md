# Open Questions

If less than 90% sure how a requirement should be implemented and the doubt does not touch security, money, tenancy or a conflict with docs/SPEC.md, choose the simplest option consistent with the SPEC, log the question, choice and why here, and continue.

## Decided & Clarifications

1. **Sprint 9 — Audit Log Immutability Enforcement Mechanism**
   - **Question/Context:** Original sprint plan specified a "restricted DB role (INSERT/SELECT only)". On shared hosting (Yegara cPanel) with a single database user, maintaining a second persistent database role or connection is restrictive and brittle.
   - **Chosen Solution:** Enforce immutability inside PostgreSQL via `BEFORE UPDATE`, `BEFORE DELETE`, and `BEFORE TRUNCATE` triggers on the `AuditLog` table that raise an exception on any modification attempt. Raw SQL tests through the application connection will verify these triggers block updates, deletes, and truncates.
   - **Known Limit:** PostgreSQL triggers cannot prevent someone with full owner/superuser privileges from executing `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER` or dropping the triggers directly.

2. **Sprint 5 — Super Admin Access Scope for Gym Settings and Subdomain Operational Views**
   - **Question/Context:** SPEC §2 Table 3.1a shows '—' for Super Admin under 'Edit gym settings: branding, member reminder days, payment credentials' while Owner is 'Yes'. Does Super Admin have access to edit gym settings or access gym-level views (logo upload, first-run checklist)?
   - **Chosen Solution:** Super Admin access is strictly limited to platform-level apex endpoints (`/api/platform/gyms/<id>/config/`) to modify entitlements (`tier`, `has_*` flags, `freeze_days_allowed`, grace and reminder days). Gym settings (`brand_color`, `member_reminder_days`, `show_unavailable_equipment`, logo) and operational views (`checklist`, `gym-logo`) on gym subdomains are strictly Owner-only. Super Admin is denied (403/401) on gym operational settings views.

3. **Sprint 11 — Payment Credentials Modification Scope**
   - **Question/Context:** Table 3.1a indicates Owner can edit payment credentials.
   - **Chosen Solution:** Payment credentials must be Owner-only (never Super Admin), encrypted at rest in `GymPaymentConfig`, and never returned by any API.
